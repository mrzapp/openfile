### What?
This plugin serializes GameObjects using JSON. It has a range of supported types built in, but more can be added manually. I am developing this in tandem with my Deus Ex-based game project [The Vongott Chronicles](http://jeppezapp.com/games/vongott/)

### Why?
It can be used for savegame files, custom level editors, carrying over information between scenes, and it probably has more applications than I can think of. If for any reason you'd want to manage your resources externally, this is your plugin.
